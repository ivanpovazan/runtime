- after getting blob index might want to use compression (COM) CorSigUncompressedDataSize etc for Document name blob index
- add pdb stream support
- add pdb-metadata object
- extend the IMetaData emitter to support required additional methods

ppdb_signature = 0x424a5342

1. introduce MetaEmit3 interface with all methods required by portable PDB
2. introduce portable PDB flag to ilasm
3. add contraint checkers for portable PDB tables
4. move document table generation to AsmInit (or wherever it is actually done on SymWritter)
5. check what to pass to document regarding hash value in ilasm
6. sorting on local scope table
7. change char to LPCUTF8 type
8. add sorting for local scope table
9. needs to have sorted bit set in order to be valid
10. locals not displaying correclty maybe take a look at pdb2pdb how it is done
